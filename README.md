DevSecOps tools play a crucial role in integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline, facilitating the automation of security checks, and ensuring that security is an integral part of the software development lifecycle. Here are some popular DevSecOps tools along with their common use cases:

Static Application Security Testing (SAST):

Tool: Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode
Use Cases: Identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in the source code during development.
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):

Tool: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, AppScan
Use Cases: Testing applications in a running state to find security vulnerabilities in runtime, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.
Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):

Tool: Contrast Security, Hdiv Security
Use Cases: Real-time analysis of applications during runtime to identify and remediate security issues.
Container Security:

Tool: Aqua Security, Twistlock, Anchore
Use Cases: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities, enforcing security policies for containerized applications, and monitoring container runtime security.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security:

Tool: Checkov, Terrascan, Bridgecrew
Use Cases: Scanning IaC templates for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, ensuring security best practices in cloud infrastructure provisioning.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):

Tool: Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), QRadar
Use Cases: Aggregating and analyzing security-related data from various sources, detecting and responding to security incidents.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration:

Tool: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI
Use Cases: Integrating security checks into the CI/CD pipeline, automating security testing and validation during the build and deployment processes.
Secrets Management:

Tool: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
Use Cases: Securely storing and managing sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and encryption keys.
Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):

Tool: Demisto (now part of Palo Alto Networks), Splunk Phantom, IBM Resilient
Use Cases: Automating incident response processes, orchestrating security workflows, and improving collaboration between security teams.
Compliance and Policy Management:

Tool: Chef Compliance, OpenSCAP, AWS Config
Use Cases: Ensuring that systems and applications comply with security policies and industry regulations.
